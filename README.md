# Old-GameMaker-Games
Old GameMaker Games I made during highschool. I made them in this order:

Bone To Be Rich - A simple top-down 2D game
Don't Fly Through My Rodgric - A space shooter
Other Super Mario  Bros. GameMaker - A 2D-Mario platformer
Luigi 911 - Another much shorter 2D-Mario platformer

These games contain many assets that I did not create, thus I do not claim credit for them. These were made for fun!
